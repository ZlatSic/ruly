# Contributing

Ruly maintainers keep track of open issues using GitHub's built in issue
tracker. If anyone wishes to solve an issue, please let us know in the issue
thread so we can assign it. When an issue is assigned to someone, they can send
a pull request (to the master branch) and we will review it and merge if it's
satisfactory. If not, we will give feedback and attempt to improve it.

Before submitting a merge request, please make sure that all the tests still
pass, that `doit check` command raises no warnings and that the documentation
is up to date with the current implementation.
